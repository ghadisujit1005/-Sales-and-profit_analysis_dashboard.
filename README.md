Sales analysis is the process of examining an organization’s sales data to evaluate performance, identify trends, and support strategic decision-making. It involves measuring total revenue, assessing product or service performance, understanding customer behavior, and comparing results across different periods or regions. By analyzing key metrics such as sales volume, profit margins, customer segments, and market conditions, businesses can uncover opportunities for growth, detect potential problems early, and optimize their sales strategies.
